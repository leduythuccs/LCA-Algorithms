# LCA_Algorithms
 Implementation & benchmarking of some LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) algorithms.

## Requirements: 
- g++ (--std=c++17)
## How to use:
If you just want to use the code for competitive programming or stuff, download the header file you need and the [edge.h](header/edge.h) file. See [Example](example/) for example cpp files.

## Todo: benchmarking
